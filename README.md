# Portfolio Website

A CV/portfolio template for developers built with React. Inspired in [react-portfolio](https://github.com/ubaimutl/react-portfolio).

To create the Typewriter effect I follow these two links

- [Typewritter Effect In React](https://medium.com/@hamzamakh/typewriter-effect-in-react-a103a4f385c9)
- [5 ways to implement typing animation in react](https://blog.logrocket.com/5-ways-implement-typing-animation-react/)

For the menu I used these codepens:

- [Split animation on hover with single element](https://codepen.io/ggsingla/pen/MWOzxbq)
- [Naviã€€Bar](https://codepen.io/yuhomyan/pen/WNwGywp)

To connect with emailjs on the contact form you can follow this guide:

- [Emailjs on react](https://medium.com/@alagappan.dev/using-emailjs-with-react-to-build-a-contact-form-for-your-website-5040966a814)
