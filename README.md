# Portfolio Website

A CV/portfolio template for developers built with React. Inspired in [react-portfolio](https://github.com/ubaimutl/react-portfolio).

To create the Typewriter effect I follow these two links

- [Typewritter Effect In React](https://medium.com/@hamzamakh/typewriter-effect-in-react-a103a4f385c9)
- [5 ways to implement typing animation in react](https://blog.logrocket.com/5-ways-implement-typing-animation-react/)

For the menu I used these codepens:

- [Split animation on hover with single element](https://codepen.io/ggsingla/pen/MWOzxbq)
- [Naviã€€Bar](https://codepen.io/yuhomyan/pen/WNwGywp)

To connect with emailjs on the contact form you can follow this guide:

- [Emailjs on react](https://medium.com/@alagappan.dev/using-emailjs-with-react-to-build-a-contact-form-for-your-website-5040966a814)

For the useApiHook I took the idea from here:

- [Creating a custom Hook to make requests using React + Axios + TypeScript](https://danilorivera95.medium.com/creating-a-custom-hook-to-make-requests-using-react-axios-typescript-ca591c6c25fc)

For the loading page I used:

- [Glowing Loader Ring Animation](https://codepen.io/Curlmuhi/pen/ExKWXKO)

To upload a JSON file directly to firebase you can use the function `initializeProfileData` that you can find on the file `src/services/fillFirebaseFromJSON.ts` that will take the info from `data_content.ts` under the same folder.

There is a button on the left bottom corner to change th theme
